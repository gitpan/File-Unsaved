NAME
    File::Unsaved - Check whether file has unsaved modification in an editor

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of File::Unsaved (from Perl
    distribution File-Unsaved), released on 2014-10-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Unsaved qw(check_file_unsaved);
     die "Can't modify foo.txt because it is being opened and modified in an editor"
         if check_file_unsaved(path => "foo.txt");

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  check_unsaved_file(%args) -> any
    Check whether file has unsaved modification in an editor.

    This function tries, using some heuristics, to find out if a file is
    being opened and has unsaved modification in an editor. Currently the
    supported editors are: Emacs, joe, vim.

    Return false if no unsaved data is detected, or else a hash structure.
    Hash will contain these keys: "editor" (kind of editor).

    The heuristics are as folow:

    *   Emacs and joe: check whether ".#<name>" (symlink) exists. Emacs
        targets the symlink to "<user>@<host>.<PID>:<timestamp>" while joe
        to "<user>@<host>.<PID>". Caveat: Unix only.

    *   vim: check whether ".<name>.swp" exists, newer than file, and its
        0x03ef-th byte has the value of "U" (which vim uses to mark the file
        as unsaved). Caveat: vim can be instructed to put swap file
        somewhere else or not create swap file at all, so in those cases
        unsaved data will not be detected.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path* => *str*

    Return value:

     (any)
