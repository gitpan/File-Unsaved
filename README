VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of File::Unsaved (from Perl
    distribution File-Unsaved), released on 2014-10-09.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Unsaved qw(check_file_unsaved);

         if check_file_unsaved(path => "foo.txt");

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  check_unsaved_file(%args) -> any
    Check whether file has unsaved modification in an editor.

    This function tries, using some heuristics, to find out if a file is
    being opened and has unsaved modification in an editor. Currently the
    supported editor is Emacs.

    Return false if no unsaved data is detected, or else a hash structure.
    Hash will contain these keys: "editor" (kind of editor).

    The heuristics are as folow:

    *   Emacs: check whether ".#<name>" (symlink) exists.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path* => *str*

    Return value:

     (any)
