This function tries, using some heuristics, to find out if a file is being
opened and has unsaved modification in an editor. Currently the supported
editors are: Emacs, joe, vim.

The heuristics are as folow:

* Emacs, joe, mc: check whether `.#<name>` symlink exists. Emacs targets the
  symlink to `<user>@<host>.<PID>:<timestamp>` while joe and mc to
  `<user>@<host>.<PID>`. Caveat: Unix only.

* vim: check whether `.<name>.swp` file exists, not older than file, and its
  0x03ef-th byte has the value of `U` (which vim uses to mark the file as
  unsaved). Caveat: vim can be instructed to put swap file somewhere else or not
  create swap file at all, so in those cases unsaved data will not be detected.

A temporary file might be stale, so checking the existence of temporary file is
not enough. If the temporary file provides pointer to a PID, and this setting is
set to true, will actually check that the PID exists.

Is activated only `check_pid` is also 1 and if `Proc::Find` (and thus

differently-named fork/derivative of said editor, although this should be rare.

Return false if no unsaved data is detected, or else a hash structure. Hash will
contain these keys: `editor` (kind of editor, possible values: `emacs`,
`joe/mc`, `joe`, `mc`, `vim`) and might contain these keys: `pid` (PID of
editor), `user`, `host`, `timestamp`.

File::Unsaved - Check whether file has unsaved modification in an editor

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.04 of File::Unsaved (from Perl distribution File-Unsaved), released on 2014-12-24.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Unsaved qw(check_unsaved_file);
 die "Can't modify foo.txt because it is being opened and modified in an editor"
     if check_unsaved_file(path => "foo.txt");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 check_unsaved_file(%args) -> bool|hash

Check whether file has unsaved modification in an editor.

This function tries, using some heuristics, to find out if a file is being
opened and has unsaved modification in an editor. Currently the supported
editors are: Emacs, joe, vim.

The heuristics are as folow:

=over

=item * Emacs, joe, mc: check whether C<< .#E<lt>nameE<gt> >> symlink exists. Emacs targets the
symlink to C<< E<lt>userE<gt>@E<lt>hostE<gt>.E<lt>PIDE<gt>:E<lt>timestampE<gt> >> while joe and mc to
C<< E<lt>userE<gt>@E<lt>hostE<gt>.E<lt>PIDE<gt> >>. Caveat: Unix only.

=item * vim: check whether C<< .E<lt>nameE<gt>.swp >> file exists, not older than file, and its
0x03ef-th byte has the value of C<U> (which vim uses to mark the file as
unsaved). Caveat: vim can be instructed to put swap file somewhere else or not
create swap file at all, so in those cases unsaved data will not be detected.

=back

Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

=over 4

=item * B<check_pid> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to check that PID is actually an editor.

A temporary file might be stale, so checking the existence of temporary file is
not enough. If the temporary file provides pointer to a PID, and this setting is
set to true, will actually check that the PID exists.

=item * B<check_proc_name> => I<bool> (default: 1)

Whether to check that process name is actually the corresponding editor.

Is activated only C<check_pid> is also 1 and if C<Proc::Find> (and thus
C<Proc::ProcessTable>) is available.

Might produce a false negative if you happen to rename the editor or use a
differently-named fork/derivative of said editor, although this should be rare.

=item * B<path>* => I<str>

=back

Return value:

 (any)

Return false if no unsaved data is detected, or else a hash structure. Hash will
contain these keys: C<editor> (kind of editor, possible values: C<emacs>,
C<joe/mc>, C<joe>, C<mc>, C<vim>) and might contain these keys: C<pid> (PID of
editor), C<user>, C<host>, C<timestamp>.
